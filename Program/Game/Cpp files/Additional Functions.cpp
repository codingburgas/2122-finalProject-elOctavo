Anyway, I became homeless.\nOne day, three costumed men abducted me in a van and put on a mask so I couldn't see. After a while,\nthey stopped the van, removed my mask, and I was in front of a mansion.\nIt turned out that the boss of the turkish mafia lives here(he also has a telsa).\nHe wanted me to place an order for him.
